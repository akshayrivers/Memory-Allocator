# Memory Slab Allocator

A high-performance, thread-safe memory allocator implemented in C, using the slab allocation technique. This allocator efficiently manages memory blocks of fixed sizes, reducing fragmentation and improving allocation speed. It uses a free list to manage memory inside slabs and supports multithreading with mutex locks.

## Features

- âœ¨ **Fixed-size block allocation**: Allocates memory in fixed-size blocks, which improves allocation efficiency.
- ðŸ”’ **Thread-safe operations**: Uses `pthread_mutex` to ensure thread safety during memory allocation and deallocation.
- âš¡ **Fast allocation and deallocation**: Reduces fragmentation and speeds up the memory management process.
- ðŸ“Š **Memory pool management**: Manages slabs of memory efficiently and allocates objects from slabs of a fixed size.
- ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive test suite**: Ensures the allocator behaves correctly under various conditions.

### Slab Memory Layout

The memory allocator organizes memory into slabs, which are essentially contiguous blocks of memory containing fixed-size objects. Each slab has a free list that manages the available blocks. When memory is allocated, blocks are taken from the free list, and when memory is deallocated, blocks are added back to the list.

### Slab Structure

- **Slab**: Holds multiple objects of the same size.
- **FreeBlock**: Represents a block of free memory in a slab, linked together in a free list.

### Memory Allocation Process

1. **Create Slab**: If no slab exists for the requested object size, a new slab is created.
2. **Allocate Memory**: Memory is allocated from a slab's free list. If the slab runs out of memory, a new slab is created.
3. **Deallocate Memory**: Memory is deallocated by adding the freed block back into the slab's free list.

### Thread Safety

The allocator is designed to be used in multithreaded environments. It uses a global mutex (`pthread_mutex_t mutex`) to ensure thread safety during memory allocation and deallocation. This prevents race conditions when accessing the slabs.

## Installation

To use the allocator, simply clone this repository and include the `main.c` file in your project.



TO Check if everything is working
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayrivers/Memory-Allocator
cd src
gcc tests.c main.c -o tests
./tests
```
TO USE IN YOUR PROGRAMS:

NOTE: Make sure that you have included main.h in your program 

```bash
gcc YOUR_PROGRAM.c main.c -o YOUR_PROGRAM
./YOUR_PROGRAM
```

## Usage

The allocator provides functions to allocate and deallocate memory. Hereâ€™s how you can use it in your code:

1. **Allocate memory**:

   ```c
   size_t object_size = 64;
   void* memory_block = allocate(object_size);
   ```

2. **Deallocate memory**:

   ```c
   deallocate(object_size, memory_block);
   ```

3. **Free all slabs**:

   To free all slabs and memory, call:

   ```c
   free_all();
   ```

## Functions

### `create_slab(size_t object_size, size_t num_objects)`

Creates a new slab for the specified object size and number of objects. Allocates memory for the slab and objects.

### `allocate_from_slab(Slab* slab)`

Allocates memory from the given slab. If the slab has no available memory, it creates a new slab.

### `deallocate_to_slab(Slab* slab, void* block)`

Deallocates the memory by adding the block back to the free list of the slab.

### `destroy_slab(Slab* slab)`

Destroys a slab, frees its memory, and removes it from the tracking list.

### `get_slab_for_size(size_t object_size)`

Retrieves the slab corresponding to the given object size. If no matching slab exists, it creates a new one.

### `allocate(size_t object_size)`

Allocates memory of the given object size from the appropriate slab.

### `deallocate(size_t object_size, void* block)`

Deallocates memory of the given object size and returns it to the appropriate slab.

### `free_all()`

Frees all slabs in the allocator's tracking array.

## Thread Safety

The allocator uses mutex locks to ensure thread safety when allocating and deallocating memory. This ensures that no data races or inconsistencies occur in a multithreaded environment.

### Thread Safety Usage

- All functions that access or modify slabs are wrapped with `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` to ensure exclusive access to the slabs.
